# Tuiteable Redux

This is a regular `create-react-app` generated with the redux template.

It contains redux toolkit, react-redux and react-router.

## Components

The app contains a few components in the features/tuits folder. TuitDetail,
TuitEdit and TuitList represent the pages for the detail, edit and list
representation of the tuits.

The component styles are based on Chakra UI. You don't need to do anything
with Chakra to complete the assignment. Just worry about the redux part.
